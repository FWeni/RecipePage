### What I learned

Feedback from the previous review really help, I found myself basically applying a few of the pointers I received to complete this project. I learned a few more html tags as well.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<li>
  <b>Total</b>: Approximately 10 minutes
</li>
```
```css
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

tr{
  border-bottom: 0.13rem solid #a09d9a;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to continue developing with HTML, CSS and Javascript, on a couple of projects. I want to truly learn responsive web development. 

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me with implementing some compontents in the solution. like making certian sections of the text be bold, I used the b tag and hr tag I used for the line that is acting as a divider.
- [Deque University](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.6/region?application=axeAPI) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the landmarks. I'd recommend it to anyone who is still new to HTML or coding.
- [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - I have referenced how to reset css from this site.
